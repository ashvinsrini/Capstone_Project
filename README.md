sentiment_pred.py used as a module for importing models.

twitter_sentiment_analysis.py uses the sentiment_pred module to predict the sentiment of our extracted tweets. 

All models pickles are also uploaded, however training and testing data are not uploaded as they exceed the upload limit, but they can be locally extracted from the script.
